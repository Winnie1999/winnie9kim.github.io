# Weather Data Dashboard

From NY NOAA data, we can get the precipitation, maximum/minimum temperature data for Central Park(NY), Waikiki(HA) and Waterhole(WA). This [dashboard](dashboard.html) contains four plots: scatter plot for Max/Min temperature, violin plot for minimum temperature, histogram for max temperature and box plot for precipitation.
